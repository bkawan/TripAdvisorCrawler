This is the only home of a person executed during the Salem Village Witchcraft Hysteria of 1692 open to the public. Another unique feature is a reproduction of the 1672 Salem Village Meeting House where many of the early hearings surrounding the Salem Witchcraft Hysteria took place. Located on the grounds is the Nurse Family Cemetery. It has been a longstanding family tradition that Rebecca's son and husband retrieved her body after her execution and secretly buried it here. A monument with a poem by John Greenleaf Whittier was erected years later to commemorate this. Recently another victim of the Hysteria, George Jacobs, was buried here after being found in the middle of the last century on his former property in a lone unmarked grave. This is the only known burial site of anyone convicted of witchcraft during the Salem trials.,Open seasonally,May-November Saturday & Sunday 10-3,July & August extended summer hours Wednesday-Sunday 10-3,October extended hours Friday-Sunday 10-3,  The Rebecca Nurse Homestead is a private non-profit museum owned by the Danvers Alarm List Coy.

Unlike common gullies, trenches or sinkholes caused by temporary flooding, the steephead ravine is a permanent feature with a spring-fed creek that never dries up, called Whitewater Branch. The underground water bubbling up cuts into the bank and carries the sand and soil downstream to the St. Johns River. Over thousands of years the ravine has widened and deepened to what you see today. In 1933, this ravine was transformed into a dramatic garden by the federal Works Progress Administration. Much of the original landscaping still exists as formal gardens and an extensive trail system. A 1.8-mile paved road winds around the ravine, offering motorists and bicyclists a view of the gardens. The Ravine Loop is closed to vehicle traffic one hour before sunset, but remains open for pedestrians, bicycles, and wheelchairs. The garden's peak flowering period is azalea season, late January to April. Numerous picnic sites, equipped with tables and grills, are available to visitors. The Roy E. Campbell Civic Center complex features a large covered pavilion, auditorium, and meeting rooms that are available for rent.

In 2012, we partnered with Shallow Sport, makers of the ultimate shallow water running fishing boats. Part of being a good fisherman is having the right equipment and these boats are the best of the best. Their unique hull design allows for tremendous rough water performance, and still permits for maneuvering in the shallow flats, where we’ll find Redfish, Trout, Flounder, Tarpon, Cobia and other near shore species. Our charters offer novice anglers as well as seasoned sports fishermen the chance to reel in impressive trophy fish. The Lowcountry’s remarkable saltwater ecosystem is unique and varied, and provides our guests exciting options for year round adventures: Spring (March–May): Redfish, Trout, Flounder, Spanish Mackerel, Whiting, Black Drum, Sheepshead, Cobia, & Jacks. Summer (June–August): Redfish, Trout, Flounder, Spanish & King Mackerel, Jacks, Ladyfish, & Tarpon. Fall (September–November): Redfish, Trout, Flounder, Whiting, Sheepshead, Black Drum, Ladyfish, & Sharks. Winter (December–February): Redfish, Trout, Sheepshead, Black Drum & Whiting.

The name Beartown was chosen because local residents claimed that the many cave-like openings in the rocks made ideal winter dens for the black bears of the area. Also, the many deep, narrow crevasses were formed in a somewhat regular criss-cross pattern and appear from above like the streets of a small town. Beartown is noted for its unusual rock formations, which are comprised of Droop, or Pottsville, Sandstone formed during the Pennsylvanian age. Massive boulders, overhanging cliffs, and deep crevasses stir the imagination of most visitors. Pocketing the face of the cliffs are hundreds of eroded pits, ranging from the size of marbles to others large enough to hold two grown men. Ice and snow commonly remain in the deeper crevasses until mid to late summer. Vegetation clings tenaciously to life, sending roots into mere cracks in the rocks.The land was purchased in 1970 with funds from the Nature Conservancy and a donation from Mrs. Edwin G. Polan, in memory of her son, Ronald Keith Neal, who lost his life in the Vietnam War. Development of the park has been minimal in order to preserve the natural attractions of the area. However, basic facilities are provided, and a boardwalk permits easy access. Interpretive signs along the boardwalk guide visitors and provide insights concerning the ecology of the area. The park is open daily from April to October. During the closed winter season foot travel to the boardwalk area is welcome, with parking available at the closed entrance gate. Group tours may be arranged by contacting the Superintendent at nearby Droop Mountain Battlefield State Park. No fee is charged to visit Beartown.",#1 of 8 things to do in Hillsboro,Beartown State Park,53 ,,Hillsboro,WV,Route . 219,,,,,,0

It features the role of the railroad in the growth of the state and Waycross. It has a locomotive, some rail cars, and a station house used as the information display area. The main building has small exhibits about the heritages of the ethnic groups, i.e. white, black and native american. It has a small display area explaining a traditional non-accompanied vocal group singing. It will host an exhibit from the Smithsonian Institute ""New Harmonies: Celebrating American Roots Music"" in the fall of 2013. While I was there I saw an exhibit of about 30 works of art by people with disabilities. This is a small community museum with small exhibits but some real gems of information. Staff is friendly and helpful. I am in no way connected with the Center.

Just seven miles east of State College and Penn State University, the vineyard and winery are located in the heart of 65 acres of land which stretches to the top of Mount Nittany.The winery was opened for business in July of 1990 by proprietors, Joe and Betty Carroll, who had been amateur winemakers for 20 years during Joe’s career as a professor in the College of Business Administration at Penn State. Their purchase in 1983 of the sixty-five acre property was followed in 1984 by the first grape plantings. The entire winemaking operation was initially contained in the original chalet-style building which now houses a state of the art bottling line. A spiral staircase leads upstairs to the tasting room and views of the adjacent pond, mountain range, and the six acre vineyard.Here at Mt. Nittany Vineyard and Winery we offer a variety of award-winning wines to suit all tastes, from dry to sweet and everything in between. Over the years we have entered many Pennsylvania as well as International Wine Competitions and have won hundreds of medals (view our medals).We are confident that you will find wines to suit your own tastes, as well as those suitable for gift-giving. To help you make a selection, you may want to know that our most popular wines are Tailgate Red, Nittany Mountain White, Nittany Mountain Blush, Mountain Rose, and Sunset.",#2 of 4 things to do in Centre Hall,Mount Nittany Vineyard & Winery,27 ,,Centre Hall,PA,300 Houser Road,18144666373,16828 ,,"Sun 12:30 pm - 4:00 pm , Sat 10:00 am - 5:00 pm , Tue - Fri 11:00 am - 5:00 pm , ",sales@mtnittanywinery.com,1
